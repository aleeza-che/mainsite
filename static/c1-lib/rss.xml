			Concept 1
		
    
  
<br>Have you ever been submerged into the water? That is—been baptized? It may be fresh in your mind because it was a pivotal moment in your life or because it happened not too long ago. For some, it may be distant, literally, because of how long ago it occurred or maybe, distant in the sense that it was not that special; just part of the process of the duties of a Christian life.<br>The purpose of exploring this concept is to propose a view of baptism that will refresh or even totally shift your perspective—of you: How heaven sees you, what you are truly capable of and the union you are called to with Christ. Unlike baptism, which is the symbol of this transformation, this leg of the journey—the counseling process mentioned in the introduction—is not instantaneous. What will be instantaneous, however, is the change in your perspective, whose power should never be underestimated as a motivating factor. Your perspective will not shift however, unless you've accepted two things. It is absolutely necessary to believe that 1) this journey, this way He is taking you, is the only way, and, 2) the only way is up—that is, superior to where you are now.<br>Before we can see that, let us look at various excerpts of scripture with fresh eyes, which can show us where we came from and where we are going.<br>
  
    Do you remember reading comprehension in grade school? The teacher would give a text and there would be questions after and all of the answers would be pulled from the text? And then if you ever got stuck on a question, the teacher would have you go back to the text? For the purpose of this study–biblical based strengthening of the foundation of our faith–after each reading, there are discussion prompt questions to help us dig deeper, but simply in our understanding of scripture. Please do your best to answer the questions as simply as you can based on the text given and not any prior knowledge you may have, even if it's biblical.

<br><br>Leading up to Genesis 6, Yahweh God has not too long ago created the earth in all it's splendor and beauty with perfectly pure human beings Adam and Eve. Just 5 chapters away from that, after the pair committed the first sin, the entire world has gone wrong and corruption is throughout.<br>
    While reading this passage, we will underline every reference to a&nbsp;man, his&nbsp;flesh or&nbsp;heart; a triangle for every reference for&nbsp;God, his&nbsp;heart or his&nbsp;feelings, including pronouns; a circle for every reference for&nbsp;God's&nbsp;Spirit, and a heart for every reference for&nbsp;Noah, including descriptors and pronouns.

Behold, I will destroy them with the earth. 14 Make yourself an ark of gopher wood.

<br><br>In this scripture we find ourselves smack dab in the middle of the 1st century after Christ's death, burial and resurrection. According to church history, in Rome, on July 18 the year 64, a massive fire breaks out, which rages for 9 days and destroys 71% of the city. In order to find someone to blame, Nero, the emperor at this time, pins the cause of the fire on Christians, after which a harsh persecution begins. Peter sends a letter to the various groups of Christians spread about in what is known as present day Turkey. This letter, which we call 1 Peter in our scriptures, warns them of the coming persecution, but encourages them to stay the course. This particular passage prompts them and us to remember the foundation of salvation, especially when times get hard.<br>
    While reading this passage, we will underline every reference to a&nbsp;man, his&nbsp;flesh or&nbsp;heart; a triangle for every reference for&nbsp;God, his&nbsp;heart or his&nbsp;feelings, including pronouns; a cross for&nbsp;Christ; a circle for every reference for&nbsp;God's&nbsp;Spirit, and a heart for every reference for&nbsp;Noah or&nbsp;you (what can be considered you), including descriptors and pronouns.

						8 Finally, all of you, be like-minded, be sympathetic, love one another, be compassionate and humble. 9 Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult. On the contrary, repay evil with blessing, because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing. 
					
          
            10 For
            Whoever desires to love life<br> and see good days,<br> let him keep his tongue from evil<br>  and his lips from speaking deceit;<br>  11 let him turn away from evil and do good;<br>  let him seek peace and pursue it.<br>12 For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, <br>and his ears are open to their prayer.<br>But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.(quoted from Psalms)
          
          
            13 Who is going to harm you if you are eager to do good? 14 But even if you should suffer for what is right, you are blessed. “Do not fear their threats; do not be frightened.” 15 But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect, 16 keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak maliciously against your good behavior in Christ may be ashamed of their slander. 17 For it is better, if it is God’s will, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil.  
					
					
             18 For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit,19 in which he went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison, 20 because they formerly did not obey, when God's patience waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through water.
          
          
            21 Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you (not the removal of the filth of the flesh, but the pledge of a good conscience toward God) through the resurrection of Jesus Christ. 22 Now that He has gone into heaven, He is at God’s right hand with angels, authorities, and powers subject to Him.

<br>
<br>Who was actually submerged under the water during the time of Noah in the flood? What happened to them?
<br>
<br>In verse 18 it says, "For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous," Thinking about the people of the flood, why did Christ have to suffer and die for people to be saved?
<br>
<br>In our previous scripture, Genesis 6, it states, “Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generation. Noah walked with God.” If Noah was saved based on this criteria, at that time, would we have been submerged or in the boat?
<br>
<br>Verse 21 says that baptism corresponds to what happened in the days of Noah. Make a comparison list of the "baptism" during Noah's time and the symbolic act that is performed today. 
<br>Terms from the scripture (v18-20) to compare:<br>

<br>
<br>What is God saying about your value to make this kind of exchange mentioned in verse 18?
<br>In our previous scripture Genesis 6:3-14,22, it only states that Noah, was righteous, blameless and walked with God, why do you think the other 7 people were saved?
<br>In verse 21, what does "the pledge of a good conscience toward God" mean?
<br>Had your current view of baptism included the back story of Noah and the Flood?

<br><br>This scripture is taken from the account of Jesus' life written by Matthew, one of His close disciples turned apostle. A figure named John the Baptist has devoted his life to living in the desert, eating locusts and wild honey, and immersing sinners into water as a sign of repentance, at the direction of God. He is also spreading the message about the coming of Jesus, which he believes he will see. At this point in the scripture, John has just rebuked the Israeli religious leaders who have come to join in on this sacred display, because of their lack of sincerity.<br>
		While reading this passage, we will put a triangle for every reference for&nbsp;God, his&nbsp;heart or his&nbsp;feelings, including pronouns; a cross for&nbsp;Jesus including pronouns; a circle for the&nbsp;Holy Spirit including pronouns; a heart around every reference for&nbsp;you or any&nbsp;followers of Christ, including descriptors and plural pronouns, and underline every reference for&nbsp;fire.

            13&nbsp;Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him. 14&nbsp;John would have prevented him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?” 15&nbsp;But Jesus answered him, “Let it be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.” Then he consented. 16&nbsp;And when Jesus was baptized, immediately he went up from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him; 17&nbsp;and behold, a voice from heaven said, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.”

<br><br>This letter written by Paul—his longest in the New Testament—was sent ahead to the city of Rome around the year AD 57, to a church he had never visited before, to people he didn't know. Some years before this letter, the booming church in Rome, which was mostly populated by Jewish converts, was emptied by the Roman Emperor Claudius, when he threw all Jews out of Rome because of their quarreling over a leader named, "Chrestus." Their exile was short lived and Jews were invited back into the city by the next emperor, but by then the population of the gentile believers in the area had grown significantly. This letter speaks on the differences and issues between Jewish and Gentile Christians. Paul makes many appeals to their spiritual natures to dismiss their national and cultural allegiances, with a desire to see them united in brotherly love. We zone in on Chapter 6, where Paul is discussing the aspects of a believer's union with Christ.<br>
    While reading this passage, we will put a triangle for every reference for&nbsp;God, including pronouns, titles etc; a cross for&nbsp;Jesus including pronouns; a line for any reference to&nbsp;man, including&nbsp;flesh and&nbsp;body and words like them; a heart around every reference for&nbsp;you or any follower of Christ, including descriptors and plural pronouns; a down arrow for&nbsp;death and words like it, and an up arrow for&nbsp;life and words like it.

					4 We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.
					
					
             5&nbsp;For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his.
            6&nbsp;For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin— 7&nbsp;because anyone who has died has been set free from sin.
            
    		
8&nbsp;Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. 9&nbsp;For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead, he cannot die again; death no longer has mastery over him. 10&nbsp;The death he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God. 11&nbsp;In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus. 


12&nbsp;Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires. 13&nbsp;Do not offer any part of yourself to sin as an instrument of wickedness, but rather offer yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life; and offer every part of yourself to him as an instrument of righteousness. 14&nbsp;For sin shall no longer be your master, because you are not under the law, but under grace.

<br>According to 6:6, what benefit is there in our union with Him?
<br>According to the text, what exchanges are being made in our union with Christ? (6:5-8)
<br>What does it mean for us to die with Christ? (6:7)
<br>Verse 6:8 says, Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. What does it mean for us to live with Christ according to verse (6:10)?
<br>If we died with Him, does that mean that we are dead to sin once and for all? (6:10)
<br>6:14 says, Sin shall no longer be your master, how was that mastery removed (6:8-9) and what do you have to do to maintain it? (6:13)
<br>In this scripture, is the new life for us referring to our lives now or life after death? What part of the text supports that?

<br>
<br>If being under the law makes sin your master, what can verse 6:14 imply that grace allows you to do?
<br>6:5 refers to what we have going on with Christ as a union. In what ways is our connection with Christ like a marriage?
<br>What does Christ get out of it?

<br>What are some positive practical things that a spouse can bring to a marriage?
<br>What are some negative practical things that a spouse can bring to a marriage?
<br>Is there any way to avoid exposure to these things?
<br>Should anything be avoided in the union of husband and wife?

            24 Now a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was an eloquent man, competent in the Scriptures. 25 He had been instructed in the way of the Lord. And being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, though he knew only the baptism of John. 26 He began to speak boldly in the synagogue, but when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more accurately. 27 And when he wished to cross to Achaia, the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him. When he arrived, he greatly helped those who through grace had believed, 28 for he powerfully refuted the Jews in public, showing by the Scriptures that the Christ was Jesus.
					
					
										19
            1 And it happened that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed through the inland country and came to Ephesus. There he found some disciples. 2 And he said to them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?” And they said, “No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.” 3 And he said, “Into what then were you baptized?” They said, “Into John's baptism.” 4 And Paul said, “John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, Jesus.” 5 On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. 6 And when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they began speaking in tongues and prophesying. 7 There were about twelve men in all.
					
					
            8 And he entered the synagogue and for three months spoke boldly, reasoning and persuading them about the kingdom of God. 9 But when some became stubborn and continued in unbelief, speaking evil of the Way before the congregation, he withdrew from them and took the disciples with him, reasoning daily in the hall of Tyrannus. 10 This continued for two years, so that all the residents of Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.
            
    		
          11 And God was doing extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul, 12 so that even handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched his skin were carried away to the sick, and their diseases left them and the evil spirits came out of them.

            14 For Christ’s love compels us, since we have reached this conclusion: If One died for all, then all died. 15 And He died for all so that those who live should no longer live for themselves, but for the One who died for them and was raised.
					
					
            16 Therefore from now on we recognize no one by the flesh; even though we have known Christ by the flesh, yet now we know Him in this way no longer. 17 Therefore if anyone is in Christ, this person is a new creation; the old things passed away; behold, new things have come. 18 Now all these things are from God, who reconciled us to Himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation, 19 namely, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not counting their wrongdoings against them, and He has committed to us the word of reconciliation.
					
					
            20 Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were making an appeal through us; we beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. 21 He made Him who knew no sin to be sin in our behalf, so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.

<br><br>Out of all the disciples and apostles, Peter and Paul stand out in the scripture for the extraordinary working of the power of God through them. Unlike Paul, Peter was closely acquainted with Jesus, spending 3 years walking alongside Him. Before Christ's death and rising, Peter received many rebukes from Christ despite his zealousness to be loyal. He seemed to be the unintentional troublemaker in the class and when there was no more time to learn and the semester was over, he found out from the Teacher that he would fail the exam that he didn't even take yet, to which he solemnly swore he would step up to the plate and pass. Alas, Peter succumbed to his fear and self-preservation and indeed denies Christ on the day He was captured to be taken to be crucified—and to ensure he was soberly thinking about it—he was given 3 opportunities, but denies Christ at each one.<br>While reading this passage, we will put a triangle for every reference for&nbsp;God, including pronouns; a cross for&nbsp;Jesus including pronouns; a circle for every reference of the&nbsp;Holy Spirit; a heart around every reference for&nbsp;you or any followers of Christ, including descriptors and plural pronouns, and a star for&nbsp;potential believers.

            1 After these things Jesus revealed Himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias, and He revealed Himself in this way: 2 Simon Peter, Thomas who was called Didymus, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of His disciples were together. 3 Simon Peter *said to them, “I am going fishing.” They *said to him, “We are also coming with you.” They went out and got into the boat; and that night they caught nothing.
					
					
            4 Just as day was breaking, Jesus stood on the shore; yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. 5 Jesus said to them, “Children, do you have any fish?” They answered him, “No.” 6 He said to them, “Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.” So they cast it, and now they were not able to haul it in, because of the quantity of fish.
					
					
            7 Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” As soon as Simon Peter heard him say, “It is the Lord,” he wrapped his outer garment around him (for he had taken it off) and jumped into the water.8 The other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they were not far from the land, but about a hundred yards off.
            
          
            9 When they got out on land, they saw a charcoal fire in place, with fish laid out on it, and bread. 10 Jesus said to them, “Bring some of the fish that you have just caught.” 11 So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore, full of large fish, 153 of them. And although there were so many, the net was not torn. 
            
          
            12 “Come and have breakfast,” Jesus told them. None of the disciples dared ask Him, “Who are You?” because they knew it was the Lord. 13 Jesus came, took the bread, and gave it to them. He did the same with the fish.
            
          
            14 This was now the third time Jesus appeared to the disciples after He was raised from the dead.
            
          
            15 When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?” He said to him, “Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.” He said to him, “Feed my lambs.” 16 He said to him a second time, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?” He said to him, “Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.” He said to him, “Tend my sheep.” 17 He said to him the third time, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?” Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, “Do you love me?” and he said to him, “Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you.” Jesus said to him, “Feed my sheep. 18 Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, you used to dress yourself and walk wherever you wanted, but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you and carry you where you do not want to go.” 19 He said this to signify by what kind of death he would glorify God. After saying this, He told him, “Follow Me!” 
            
            20 So Peter turned around and saw the disciple Jesus loved following them. That disciple was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper and asked, “Lord, who is the one that’s going to betray You?” 21 When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, “Lord—what about him?” 22 “If I want him to remain until I come,” Jesus answered, “what is that to you? As for you, follow Me.”

<br>How can you tell, from this text, how Peter feels about Christ before they even speak?
<br>What does Jesus do for them when he appears?
<br>Why do you think they weren't able to fish successfully?
<br>Why do you think Jesus calls them children?
<br>What can verse 11 tell us about what Jesus' presence does for Peter?
<br>Has Peter proven by his actions that he will be a faithful servant, only based on what he has done up to this point? *We are taking into consideration his denial not mentioned in this text.
<br>What can it mean that Peter is chosen after failing so badly (denial) after walking closely with Christ for 3 years?
<br>What does Peter admit the third time Jesus asks him if he loves Him?
<br>If Peter is chosen at this point, without proof of faithfulness, what is Christ looking for? What is he asking Peter?
<br>Does this text prove Peter's commitment or Jesus' commitment? How?

<br>
<br>This is the 3rd time according to the text that Peter has seen Jesus. The previous 2 times, Jesus doesn't mention his betrayal. What could you imagine he feels not hearing Jesus' thoughts on it?
<br>How do you imagine he feels once he does hear it?
<br>Is Jesus asking Peter if he loves Him to find out if it’s true?
<br>Thinking about our previous reflection question,"What can love do to a person's drive or motivation to do something?" What could be Jesus' reason for revealing to Peter the kind of death by which he would glorify God–after asking Peter if he loves him 3 times? (v. 18-19)
<br>According to the exchange in the text between Jesus and Peter, do you think that Peter feels adequate when He's instructed to feed Yeshua's lambs? Can you relate to this?

<br><br>Some recognize the book of Ephesians as Paul's general letter, applicable to any church community that expounds on His core and foundational beliefs because some of the earliest manuscripts don't have the greeting in 1:1–which is the only place the name Ephesus is found. This letter is not addressing any moral issues or answering any theological questions. It is a plain foundational doctrine.  Paul carefully dissects this letter into two parts. In part one which covers chapters 1-3, Paul speaks on the underlying foundation of salvation–which is the love and predisposition of the Godhead toward the chosen. Part two is a call to walk out this calling with confidence, assurance, perseverance and determination, which completely depends on part one.<br>While reading this passage, we will put a triangle for every reference for&nbsp;God, including pronouns; a cross for&nbsp;Jesus including pronouns; a circle for every reference of the&nbsp;Holy Spirit; a heart around every reference for&nbsp;you i.e. the church, including descriptors and plural pronouns, an underline for the word&nbsp;heart; and a star for&nbsp;potential believers; , and an up arrow for&nbsp;strength/power.

            8 To me, the very least of all saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unfathomable riches of Christ,  9&nbsp;and to enlighten all people as to what the plan of the mystery is which for ages has been hidden in God, who created all things; 10 so that the multifaceted wisdom of God might now be made known through the church to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly places. 11 This is according to His eternal purpose accomplished in the Messiah, Jesus our Lord. 12&nbsp;In Him we have boldness and confident access through faith in Him. 13 So then I ask you not to be discouraged over my afflictions on your behalf, for they are your glory.
					
          
            14 For this reason I kneel before the Father, 15 from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name.  16 I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being, 17 so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith.         
 And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love, 18 may have power, together with all the Lord’s holy people, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ, 19 and to know this love that surpasses knowledge—that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.

If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing. 6&nbsp;If you do not remain in me, you are like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned. 7&nbsp;If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. 8&nbsp;This is to my Father’s glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples.
					
          
            9&nbsp;“As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Now remain in my love. 10&nbsp;If you keep my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have kept my Father’s commands and remain in his love. 11&nbsp;I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete. 12&nbsp;My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. 13&nbsp;Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends. 14&nbsp;You are my friends if you do what I command. 15&nbsp;I no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know his master’s business. Instead, I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you. 16&nbsp;You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit—fruit that will last—and so that whatever you ask in my name the Father will give you. 17&nbsp;This is my command: Love each other.  
            
              18&nbsp;“If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. 19&nbsp;If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you. 20&nbsp;Remember what I told you: ‘A servant is not greater than his master.’ If they persecuted me, they will persecute you also. If they obeyed my teaching, they will obey yours also. 21&nbsp;They will treat you this way because of my name, for they do not know the one who sent me. 22&nbsp;If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin. 23&nbsp;Whoever hates me hates my Father as well.

<br><br>In this scripture, the split kingdom Judah and Israel are being warned by yet another prophet of their bad behavior. Judah, representing two tribes—Judah and Benjamin—ruled by kings coming from the line of David; and Israel represented by the other 10 tribes, ruled by various other kings. Around 735 BC, as an illustration to Israel of how they were treating YHWH, this prophet, Hosea, was instructed by YHWH God to marry a prostitute and have children with her. She had 3 children —unknown whether Hosea was the father of all of them or not—named "God Plants" (Jezreel), "Not Loved" or "Not Pitied" and "Not My-People."<br>While reading this passage, we will put a triangle for every reference for&nbsp;God, including pronouns; a heart around every reference for&nbsp;Israel, including descriptors and plural pronouns, and an underline for phrases that convey&nbsp;commitment.

          The Hebrew translation for the words "My Master" is Ba'al, which is more literally translated as owner. It is used as a play on words that Israel won't even use the term "my master" with God anymore, just so that she will not utter the names of her former gods.
        
			
			
				
					
            2“Plead with your mother, plead—for she is not my wife,and I am not her husband—that she put away her whoring from her face, and her adultery from between her breasts;3 lest I strip her naked and make her as in the day she was born,and make her like a wilderness,and make her like a parched land, and kill her with thirst. 4 I will not show my love to her children, because they are the children of adultery.5 Their mother has been unfaithful and has conceived them in disgrace. She said, ‘I will go after my lovers, who give me my food and my water, my wool and my linen, my olive oil and my drink.'
          
          
            6 Therefore I will block her path with thornbushes; I will wall her in so that she cannot find her way. 7&nbsp;She will pursue her lovers but not catch them; she will seek them but not find them. Then she will think, “I will go back to my former husband, for then it was better for me than now.” 8 She has not acknowledged that I was the one who gave her the grain, the new wine and oil, who lavished on her the silver and gold—which they used for Baal.
          
          
            9 “Therefore I will take away my grain when it ripens, and my new wine when it is ready.I will take back my wool and my linen, intended to cover her naked body.  10 Now I will expose her shame in the sight of her lovers, and no one will rescue her from My hands. 11 I will put an end to all her celebrations: her feasts, New Moons, and Sabbaths—all her festivals. 12 And I will destroy her vines and fig trees, Of which she said, ‘They are my wages for prostitution Which my lovers have given me.’ And I will turn them into a forest, And the animals of the field will devour them. 13 I will punish her for the days she burned incense to the Baals; she decked herself with rings and jewelry, and went after her lovers, but me she forgot,” declares the Lord.
          
          
            14 “Therefore I am now going to allure her; I will lead her into the wilderness and speak tenderly to her. 15 There I will give her vineyards back to her and make the Valley of Achor into a gateway of hope. There she will respond as she did in the days of her youth,as in the day she came out of the land of Egypt.
          
          
            16 "In that day,” declares the Lord, “you will call me ‘my husband’; you will no longer call me ‘my master'. 17 For I will remove the names of the Baals from her mouth, and they shall be remembered by name no more. 18 On that day I will make a covenant for them with the wild animals, the birds of the sky, and the creatures that crawl on the ground. I will shatter bow, sword, and weapons of war in the land and will enable the people to rest securely.
          
          
            19 I will take you to be My wife forever. I will take you to be My wife in righteousness, justice, love, and compassion. 20 I will betroth you in faithfulness,and you will acknowledge the Lord.21 “In that day I will respond,” declares the Lord— “I will respond to the skies,and they will respond to the earth; 22 and the earth will respond to the grain, the new wine and the olive oil,and they will respond to Jezreel. 23 I will plant her for myself in the land; I will show my love to the one I called ‘Not my loved one.’ I will say to those called ‘Not my people,’ ‘You are my people’; and they will say, ‘You are my God.’”

<br><br>The people of Israel have just been personally rescued from slavery to Pharaoh in Egypt by YHWH with 10 dazzling but deadly plagues. In His latest feat before this text, He empowers Moses to split the red sea in front of them allowing the Israelis pass through it; after which closes up and drowns Pharaoh and his chariots—who were in hot pursuit of the people. He then leads them out of Egypt with riches and takes them to the desert where He provides them water and manna, an edible substance straight from heaven, for sustenance. It is after these things that YHWH sets up the following ceremony.<br>While reading this passage, we will put a triangle for every reference for&nbsp;God, including pronouns; a heart around every reference for&nbsp;Israel, and an underline for the word&nbsp;covenant or words like it.

          1 On the third new moon after the people of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt, on that day they came into the wilderness of Sinai. 2 They set out from Rephidim and came into the wilderness of Sinai, and they encamped in the wilderness. There Israel encamped before the mountain, 3 while Moses went up to God. The Lord called to him out of the mountain, saying, “Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob, and tell the people of Israel: 4 ‘You yourselves have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself. 5 Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be my treasured possession among all peoples, for all the earth is mine; 6 and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’ These are the words that you shall speak to the people of Israel.”
        
        
		  7 So Moses came and called the elders of the people and set before them all these words that the Lord had commanded him. 8 All the people answered together and said, “All that the Lord has spoken we will do.” And Moses reported the words of the people to the Lord.

			Concept 1 - The Proposal
		
    
  
<br>As we conclude concept 1, The Proposal, reflect on the scriptures we have examined. Think about what the bible says the baptism of water is, why it came about and the purpose for it.<br>Here are some ideas that we’ve encountered:<br>
<br>Noah and the flood as the very first baptism. Genesis 6:3-14,22
<br>Christ’s submerging and suffering to exchange His life for ours. 1 Peter 3:8-22
<br>Our submerging to exchange our dead lives for His life–which may cause us suffering. 1 Peter 3:8-22
<br>The second baptism of the Holy Spirit and Fire having two parts. Matthew 3:11–4:1
<br>The Fire part of the second baptism referring to Christ's winnowing fork. Matthew 3:11–4:1
<br>The participation of Christ in our consequence of grieving God, our participation in the benefit of His sacrifice and of never having grieved God. Romans 6:4-14
<br>The necessity of the baptism of the Holy Spirit and Fire. Acts 19:1-12
<br>The death represented in our baptism of repentance resulting in our rebirth as something completely new; fused with Christ with a completely new trajectory. 2 Corinthians 5:14-21
<br>The proposal of Christ coming after the failure of the flesh proving Christ's devotion as a total act of love. John 21:1-22
<br>Resetting the foundation of our faith with God's love and also with Christ's love. Ephesians 3:8-19
<br>Viewing Christ's actions not only as duty, but as an expression of his desired relationship with us. John 15:5-23
<br>True marriage and God's faithfulness in it. Hosea 2:14-23
<br>The commitment to true and full dependency forever. Exodus 19:1-8
<br>I invite you to pray. Ask the Holy Spirit to guide you to your next steps with the Deity. ]]></description><link>https://dependentwell.com/the-kings-college/the-kings-college/c1-3nf38o/concept-1/unit-12-conclusion.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">the-kings-college/c1-3nf38o/Concept 1/Unit 12 - Conclusion.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Aleeza Chery]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 08 Sep 2024 19:17:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Clean & Pure Introduction]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br><br><br>
Out of all of the scriptures of the bible, nothing quite captures the angst we may sometimes feel as believers when we are not fulfilling the potential we know is there within us, like in Romans 7, where Apostle Paul declares, "O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" This can be especially frustrating in light of the goodness of God that we have experienced and our knowledge of the scriptures. The good we desire to do sometimes ridiculously eludes us and the motivation we once had seems to flap in the wind like a tattered and weather beaten flag, flickering here and there, but not standing at full mast as it once did. The last of the energy to pursue Kingdom like "good" Christians should, has fizzled out and left us struggling to make what seems like simple and straight forward decisions.<br>This study, based on biblical truths, suggests our issue may be that our current fuel is not efficient nor effective in producing lasting and consistent obedience; that current fuel being, feelings. If we operate by doing what we feel like doing, our flesh will make it impossible for us to experience the victory that is already ours through Christ Jesus. That is because feelings are the perfect fuel for the flesh and sub-optimal for the spirit. We need a fuel that goes beyond feelings, one that runs through the spiritual being, producing life, even when we find ourselves in the most perplexing of circumstances.<br>What if it isn't just the fuel that needs to be changed but the inner workings of the spirit man that need a tune up? Here enters soul care, the maintenance that we didn't want but truly need to be everything He's called us to be and we know we could be.<br>If we knew how to consistently operate outside of feelings, we'd be doing it already. The resistance we are facing in this spiritual paralysis mimics a body system overrun with toxicity. The organs of the spirit; the non-physical heart, mind and soul are bogged down with spiritual toxins like unresolved hurts, traumas, bad habits made out of good intentions, not to mention uncombated oppression from the enemy.<br>These things and more have zapped our strength and maybe worse, even skewed our perception of the Godhead, and ourselves. Jesus' sacrifice doesn't just offer salvation of the soul, healing of the body and resurrection life. He was also prophesied to be the Wonderful Counselor, so we can follow the command to love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind and strength.<br>This is a study on how to allow yourself to be counseled directly by the Spirit of Christ.<br>For some, you may not be feeling like you are at your wits end, as it is described above, but you know there is more that you want to experience and can experience in this life with Christ. You have a hunger and thirst for righteousness and a desire to see the Kingdom of God expanded like never before and all you want to do is get in line. Preparation and God-readiness is required to subdue your dreams. There may be things that He needs to address that you may or may not know are there–before you are unleashed on assignment. That requires His counsel. That requires soul care.<br>Although this not a self help on how to become your best you, that will inevitably end up happening if you allow Christ to counsel you and change you from a feelings-driven, sometimey-Christian, to one who rises to the occasion; not allowing sin or circumstance to rattle your eagle-eye view. You are not doing this to become a more productive child of God; you are doing it as an acceptance of a marriage proposal that will unify you into the family of God in a way that brings value to the family. The value that He has seen in you all along.<br>This Course uses the inductive Bible study method which draws it's conclusions based on what was studied from the text which is different from deductive bible study in which we bring our predisposed assumptions, whether original or learned to interpret the text being examined. It's main steps are observation, interpretation and application and it's main goal is to bring deeper and genuine understanding of scripture.<br>American Author and believer Kay Arthur, founder of Precept Ministries created a visual method for use in tandem with the inductive Bible study method. For this study, we've borrowed some of the techniques used in the Precept Bible Study Method™. Find out more at Precept.org<br>Before we dive into the study, let's do the most important thing of all: let's invite God into this conversation through prayer. Take a moment to ask Him to speak to you through His written Word, the Bible.]]></description><link>https://dependentwell.com/the-kings-college/the-kings-college/c1-3nf38o/clean-&amp;-pure-introduction.html</link><guid
