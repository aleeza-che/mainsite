 <br> Clean &amp; Pure: An Introduction to Soul Care - Concept 2 - The Divorce

		
			Concept 2
		
    
  
<br>We are beings who posses both spirit and flesh; and because of the intertwining of our spirit and flesh, it can be easy for us to become obstructed from executing our faith purely. Understanding the flesh and the protocol for managing it is key for maintaining the victory that we desire to have in our everyday lives. In the introduction to the entire study, we referenced Paul's struggle with the flesh in Romans 7. Paul makes the statement later on in that chapter, "For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out."<br>The purpose of this concept is to make the clear distinction found in scripture between the spirit and flesh and to recognize that the flesh cannot be made into anything that is useful for the Kingdom of God. Morality is not Christianity. In order for us to say yes to the proposal of Christ, we must first have a divorce of our current spouse; the flesh.<br>Once again, let us look at various excerpts of scripture with fresh eyes, to allow this work to be done. Hebrews 4:12 says, “For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.”<br>
  
    Do you remember reading comprehension in grade school? The teacher would give a text and there would be questions after and all of the answers would be pulled from the text? And then if you ever got stuck on a question, the teacher would have you go back to the text? For the purpose of this study–biblical based strengthening of the foundation of our faith–after each reading, there are discussion prompt questions to help us dig deeper, but simply in our understanding of scripture. Please do your best to answer the questions as simply as you can based on the text given and not any prior knowledge you may have, even if it's biblical.

 <br> Clean &amp; Pure: An Introduction to Soul Care - Concept 2 - The Divorce
	
    		
    
  
<br><br>This book of the Gospel of Christ written by John is very different from the other three gospels in many ways; too many to list in this backdrop. John—who is believed to be the closest disciple to Jesus and refers to himself in the writings as the one Jesus loved—focuses on the revelation of who Christ is in his entire identity; especially as the Son of God, and mentions the word believe almost 100 times. This book documents Jesus' 7 “I AM” statements, highlights 7 miracles done by Him, and confirms the witness of 7 persons declaring that He, indeed, is the Son of God. By this chapter, 2, Jesus has already been baptized by water and the Spirit, chosen his disciples and begun his public ministry—where He challenges many schools of thought.<br>For instance, the Pharisees were a self-appointed overseer group in Israel who set up their own laws, nitpicking and monitoring the activities of their fellow Israelis. They emerged in opposition to the Sadducees, the party of the Jewish high priesthood instated by the law of Moses. Pharisees rejected blind adherence to the law if it conflicted with human rationale or conscience. They believed1 “humans must use their reason in interpreting the Torah and [in] applying it to contemporary problems.” We drop in on Jesus' ministry right when he's about to have a conversation with a Pharisee named Nicodemus.<br>
	While reading this passage, we will put a&nbsp;cross for every reference to Jesus, including pronouns or titles; a triangle for every reference for&nbsp;God, including pronouns; a circle for every reference for the&nbsp;Holy Spirit; an up arrow for every reference to being&nbsp;born; a line under&nbsp;flesh, people, man or mankind, and an exclamation mark for&nbsp;believe and words like it.

					In Numbers 21, the people of Israel, became discouraged and grumbled against God; despising the manna He gave them, while traveling in the desert under His care by way of Moses’ leadership. God sent fiery snakes among them and many died, but God instructed Moses to make a snake sculpture out of brass, set it on a pole so that anyone who was bitten but then looked at the sculpture did not die from the snake bites.

						23 Now when He was in Jerusalem at&nbsp;the Passover, during the feast, many believed in His name as they&nbsp;observed His signs which He was doing. 24 But Jesus, on His part, was not entrusting Himself to them, because&nbsp;He knew all people, 25 and because He did not need anyone to testify about mankind,&nbsp;for He Himself knew what was in mankind.

						1 Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named&nbsp;Nicodemus, a&nbsp;ruler of the Jews; 2 this man came to Jesus at night and said to Him, “Rabbi, we know that You have come from God as a teacher; for no one can do these signs that You do unless God is with him.” 3 Jesus responded and said to him,&nbsp;“Truly, truly, I say to you, unless someone&nbsp;is born&nbsp;again he cannot see&nbsp;the kingdom of God.”
					
					
						4 Nicodemus *said to Him, “How can a person be born when he is old? He cannot enter his mother’s womb a second time and be born, can he?” 5 Jesus answered,&nbsp;“Truly, truly, I say to you, unless someone is born of&nbsp;water and&nbsp;the&nbsp;Spirit, he cannot enter&nbsp;the kingdom of God. 6 &nbsp;That which has been born of the flesh is flesh, and that which has been born of the Spirit is spirit. 7 &nbsp;Do not be amazed that I said to you, ‘You must be born&nbsp;again.’ 8 The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it is coming from and where it is going; so is everyone who has been born of the Spirit.”
					
					
            9 Nicodemus responded and said to Him, “How can these things be?” 10 Jesus answered and said to him,&nbsp;“You are&nbsp;the teacher of Israel, and&nbsp;_yet_&nbsp;you do not understand these things? 11 Truly, truly, I say to you,&nbsp;we speak of what we know and&nbsp;testify of what we have seen, and&nbsp;you&nbsp;_people_&nbsp;do not accept our testimony. 12 &nbsp;If I told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things? 13 No one has ascended into heaven, except&nbsp;He who descended from heaven:&nbsp;the Son of Man. 14 And just as&nbsp;Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness , so must&nbsp;the Son of Man&nbsp;be lifted up, 15 so that everyone who&nbsp;believes will&nbsp;have eternal life in Him.
					
					
            16&nbsp;“For God so&nbsp;loved the world, that He&nbsp;gave His&nbsp;only Son, so that everyone who&nbsp;believes in Him will not perish, but have eternal life. 17For God&nbsp;did not send the Son into the world&nbsp;to judge the world, but so that the world might be saved through Him. 18&nbsp;The one who believes in Him is not judged; the one who does not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of&nbsp;the only Son of God. 19 &nbsp;And this is the judgment, that&nbsp;the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light; for&nbsp;their deeds were evil. 20 For everyone who does evil hates the Light, and does not come to the Light, so that his deeds will not be exposed. 21 But the one who&nbsp;practices the truth comes to the Light, so that his deeds will be revealed&nbsp;as having been performed in God.”

<br>Have you ever been confused by something you believed God said? 
<br>Would you say you avoid thinking about things like that or do you ask a multitude of questions like Nicodemus?

<br><br>(Repeated from Concept 1) This letter written by Paul—his longest in the New Testament—was sent ahead to the city of Rome circa the year AD 57, to a church he had never visited before, to people he didn't know. Some years before this letter, the booming Christian church in Rome, filled with Jewish converts, was emptied by the Roman Emperor Claudius, when he threw all Jews out of Rome because of their quarreling over a leader named, "Chrestus." The exile was short lived and Jews were invited back into the city by the next emperor, but by then the population of the gentile believers in the area had grown.<br>This letter speaks on the differences and issues between Jewish and Gentile Christians. Paul makes many appeals to their spiritual natures to dismiss their national and cultural allegiances, with a desire to see them united in brotherly love. We zone in on Chapter 6, where Paul is discussing what freedom from sin really means.<br>
    While reading this passage, we will put a cross for every reference to&nbsp;Jesus, including pronouns or titles; a triangle for every reference for&nbsp;God, including pronouns; a circle for every reference for the&nbsp;Holy Spirit; a heart for every reference for&nbsp;you or what can be considered you; an up arrow for every reference for&nbsp;life, righteousness and the like ; a line under&nbsp;flesh, or heart; a down arrow for&nbsp;death, sin and the like; a box around&nbsp;law and the like.

						16 Don’t you know that when you offer yourselves to someone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one you obey—whether you are slaves to sin, which leads to death, or to obedience, which leads to righteousness? 17&nbsp;But thanks be to God that, though you used to be slaves to sin, you have come to obey from your heart the pattern of teaching that has now claimed your allegiance. 18    You have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness. 19    I am speaking in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you presented the parts of your body as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness, resulting in further lawlessness, so now present your body’s parts as slaves to righteousness, resulting in sanctification.
					
					
						20 When you were slaves to sin, you were free from the control of righteousness. 21 What benefit did you reap at that time from the things you are now ashamed of? Those things result in death! But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the benefit you reap leads to holiness, and the result is eternal life. 22 For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
					
					
					
							7
						
						1 Do you not know, brothers and sisters—for I am speaking to those who know the law—that the law has authority over someone only as long as that person lives? 2 For example, by law a married woman is bound to her husband as long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law that binds her to him. 3 So then, if she has sexual relations with another man while her husband is still alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from that law and is not an adulteress if she marries another man.
					
		           
					4 So, my brothers and sisters, you also died to the law through the body of Christ, that you might belong to another, to him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit for God.
					
					
					5 For while we were in the flesh, the sinful passions, which were brought to light by the Law, were at work in the parts of our body to bear fruit for death.  6 But now we have been released from the law, since we have died to what held us, so that we may serve in the new way of the Spirit and not in the old letter of the law.

<br>
<br>According to verse 6:17, where does true obedience come from?
<br>According to 6:16, what do you do to become the slave, even before you obey?
<br>According to verse 6:18, does freedom end slavery?
<br>Who does the law have authority over? (7:1)
<br>In verse 7:4, what has to happen in order for us to belong to another because of the law?
<br>Verse 7:4 says, you also died to the law through the body of Christ, that you might belong to another, to him who was raised from the dead... In the analogy in verses 7:1-3 about marriage and adultery, who would Christ be according to verse 7:4?
<br>Who would you be in the analogy in verses 7:1-3 according to verse 7:4 you also died to the law through the body of Christ?
<br>What do we produce when we belong to Christ (7:4)?
<br>Staying with the marriage analogy in 7:1-3, if there is offspring produced from being in Christ, who is the old husband according to verse 7:5?
<br>What was the offspring produced from the old marriage according to verse 7:5?
<br>According to the text (7:4-6) Can obeying the law produce fruit for God?
<br>According to verse 7:6, who must we obey to produce fruit for God?
<br>What are the benefits of slavery to God? (6:22)
<br>Going back to the very beginning of this text, how do you become a slave of God?
<br>If a person is not a slave to God, who are they a slave to according to verse 6:16?
<br>Looking again to the marriage analogy in 7:1-3, can we be in Christ and in the flesh at the same time?
<br>Is it possible to bear fruit for God without dying to the flesh and being in Christ?

<br>
<br>According to what was in the scripture referenced, is there any benefit in using the law for sanctification?
<br>In the example above the term adultery is used to describe being under the law, what feeling does that produce in you to think about it that way?

<br><br>In the interest of offering an explanation for splitting chapters in our readings, this backdrop will focus primarily on the onset of chapters and verses used to classify scripture. Chapters and verses, which are not present in any original manuscripts of scripture were added for easier indexing. In 1205, thou he was not the first, Dominican, Stephen Langton created the chapter divisions which are used today.<br>By the mid-16th century, editors brought in smaller, verse divisions, largely inspired by Jewish scriptural texts, whose units were implemented using special Hebrew letters and punctuation.<br>Jewish scriptural text, however, utilize about 116 more verse breaks as it concerns the Old Testament, because of they way the Psalms are divided.<br>As it concerns the New Testament, Italian Dominican biblical scholar, Santes Pagnino is credited as the first to implement versification there, but his version was not widely adopted–his divisions were very long. The verse divisions that are widely used today were created in 1151 by French printer Robert Estienne.<br>As described in our previous reading for this concept, this letter written by Paul speaks on the differences and issues between Jewish and Gentile Christians. Paul makes many appeals to their spiritual natures desiring to see them united in brotherly love.<br>We zone in on Chapter 7, where Paul breaks down the mechanisms operating within the system of the human being as it concerns: the law, sin, the flesh and the spirit.<br>
	While reading this passage, we will put a cross for every reference to&nbsp;Jesus, including pronouns or titles; a triangle for every reference for&nbsp;God, including pronouns; a circle for every reference for the&nbsp;the Spirit/spirit; a heart for every reference for&nbsp;believers; an up arrow for every reference for&nbsp;life, righteousness and the like; a line under&nbsp;flesh, or body and the like; a down arrow for&nbsp;death, sin and the like; a box around&nbsp;law; a squiggly line for&nbsp;commandment, and this symbol for&nbsp;good.

			The well know clause usually found in this verse is not found here in the earliest manuscripts of this letter, instead it is found in verse 4 where it also occurs. Scholars do not agree on whether this was error by the scribes or intentional by authorities who did not want Paul's words to be taken out of context.

						7 What shall we say then? Is the Law sin? Far from it! On the contrary, I would not have come to know sin except through the Law; for I would not have known about coveting if the Law had not said, “You shall not covet.” 8 But sin, taking an opportunity through the commandment, produced in me coveting of every kind; for apart from the Law sin is dead. 9 I was once alive apart from the Law; but when the commandment came, sin came to life, and I died; 10 and this commandment, which was to result in life, proved to result in death for me; 11 for sin, taking an opportunity through the commandment, deceived me, and through it, killed me. 12 So then, the Law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good.
					
					
						13 Therefore did that which is good become a cause of death for me? Far from it! Rather it was sin, in order that it might be shown to be sin by bringing about my death through that which is good, so that through the commandment sin would become utterly sinful.
					
					
						14 For we know that the Law is spiritual, but I am fleshly, sold into bondage to sin. 15 For I do not understand what I am doing; for I am not practicing what I want to do, but I do the very thing I hate. 16 However, if I do the very thing I do not want to do, I agree with the Law, that the Law is good. 17 But now, no longer am I the one doing it, but sin that dwells in me. 18 For I know that good does not dwell in me, that is, in my flesh; for the willing is present in me, but the doing of the good is not. 19 For the good that I want, I do not do, but I practice the very evil that I do not want. 20 But if I do the very thing I do not want, I am no longer the one doing it, but sin that dwells in me.
					
					
						21 I find then the principle that evil is present in me, the one who wants to do good. 22 For I joyfully agree with the law of God in the inner person, 23 but I see a different law in the parts of my body waging war against the law of my mind, and making me a prisoner of the law of sin, the law which is in my body’s parts. 24 Wretched man that I am! Who will set me free from the body of this death? 25 Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord!
					
					
            
							8
            
            So then, on the one hand I myself with my mind am serving the law of God, but on the other, with my flesh the law of sin.1 Therefore there is now no condemnation at all for those who are in Christ Jesus. 2 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death.
          
          
            3 For what the Law could not do, weak as it was through the flesh, God did: sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and as an offering for sin, He condemned sin in the flesh, 4 so that the requirement of the Law might be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. 5 For those who are in accord with the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who are in accord with the Spirit, the things of the Spirit. 6 For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the Spirit is life and peace, 7 because the mind set on the flesh is hostile toward God; for it does not subject itself to the law of God, for it is not even able to do so, 8 and those who are in the flesh cannot please God.
					
					
						9 However, you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Him. 10 If Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is alive because of righteousness. 11 But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you.
					
					
            12 So then, brothers and sisters, we are under obligation, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh— 13 for if you are living in accord with the flesh, you are going to die; but if by the Spirit you are putting to death the deeds of the body, you will live. 14 For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these are sons and daughters of God. 15 For you have not received a spirit of slavery leading to fear again, but you have received a spirit of adoption as sons and daughters by which we cry out, “Abba! Father!” 16 The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God, 17 and if children, heirs also, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him so that we may also be glorified with Him.

  Please do your best to answer the questions as simply as you can based on the text given and not any prior knowledge you may have, even if it's biblical. <br><br>Questions with asterisks* may inquire about general definitions and meaning not found in the text, for those you may use your common knowledge.

  
<br>
<br>What is used to produce the desire to sin?&nbsp;(7:8)
<br>What are the other two laws at work described in this text?&nbsp;(8:2)
<br>If the law is the written commands of God given by Moses, what is the law of the Spirit of life?
<br>What does it mean to "walk according to"?&nbsp;(8:4)
<br>From our previous scripture's text,&nbsp;(6:16-7:6), what do you become to whom you obey?
<br>In&nbsp;(7:9), what does it mean that "I died" in that verse?
<br>What caused the death?
<br>According to 7:11, what has to happen first in order for sin to do the killing and come alive?&nbsp;(7:11)
<br>If deception/misleading is involved, what kind of desires would you say the flesh has? natural desires? evil desires? something else?*
<br>What does it mean to have a mind that is set on the flesh?&nbsp;(8:5)
<br>What does "living in accord with the flesh" mean?&nbsp;(8:13)
<br>Can the flesh be put into submission?&nbsp;(8:7-8)
<br>After reading this scripture, once sin is activated or made alive in the flesh, can it be removed from the flesh?
<br>Thinking about the aside marked with a red asterisk, If condemn used here is referring to sentencing what can it mean that sin in condemned in the flesh?
<br>Does Jesus eradicate sin in a believer with the sacrifice He made?
<br>Where does sin reside?
<br>According to&nbsp;(8:10), what causes the Spirit to live?
<br>According to&nbsp;(8:10), what do you need in you to produce this righteousness?
<br>If Christ was born in the likeness of sinful flesh, does that mean he was sinful?&nbsp;(8:3)
<br>Hebrews 4:14-15&nbsp;says,&nbsp;Since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin.&nbsp;According to our text, Romans 7:7-8:17, How do you think He was able to remain sinless even though He was born in the likeness of sinful flesh?
<br>How is the righteous standard of the law fulfilled in us?&nbsp;(8:4)
<br>What is a product of the mind set on the Spirit?&nbsp;(8:6)

<br><br>What if setting your mind on the Spirit and setting your mind on the flesh were a very simple practical concept? Let try an exercise. <br>Below are some prompts. I want you to close your eyes or open them what ever you prefer and actively start thinking about the prompt for 5 seconds. <br><br>
<br>The gas station
<br>The Dr's office
<br>Tonight's dinner
<br>A peaceful time of worship in a comfortable place
<br>A crying baby
<br>Traffic
<br>Orange Juice
<br><br>This time along with thinking about it, use your imagination to visualize it in your mind in deeper detail. This time for 15 seconds.<br>
<br>Gas station: You arrive at the gas station because your car is on a quarter tank. The gas station is full and so you have to wait, but then just 2 seconds later, the closet car to you pulls off and you pull in.
<br>The Dr's Office: You've been patiently waiting at the Dr's office for over 30 minutes and just as you're about to get up to leave, the nurse calls your name. She offer you an apology but also per their policy they hand you a $50 Visa gift card for having to wait more than 30 minutes.
<br>Tonight's dinner: You already prepped all of your ingredients before you went off for work. The day was long and your winding down your street all ready to cook and enjoy. You walk in the house and your brother who was visiting has already anticipated your arrival and has a warm dinner waiting on the table.
<br>A peaceful time of worship in a comfortable place: You've been very stressed lately and when you wake early on Sunday morning, you feel led to go to a church you used to attend years ago for bible study. You arrive and you feel God's loving embrace at the door. You experience a child like joy and time of worship that you've been longing for.
<br>A crying baby: As you walk up the corridor to board your plane, you can already hear a fussing baby and accompanying mother cooing, trying her best. As you settle into your seat and find your headphones you notice a kind woman from first class ask to help the distressed mother who takes the baby and gently bounces him to sleep.
<br><br>In the room that you are in begin to imagine each object being specifically part of the plan of God concerning His kingdom. Objects are not just thing that you see, but things that you hear, smell–the senses really, only you are not focusing on them as they are, but as reminders of keeping you mind set on the Spirit.<br>Look, listen or smell around, and any object that has grasped your attention, make a note in your mind or even better speak to the Holy Spirit in your mind about that object. You can, make a simple statement, i.e; the chair is white. Ask a question, i.e, what is that floral smell?, or acknowledge with gratitude, i.e; thank you for this pencil. Every time you do one write down the object just to keep track of how many. You will stop at 10.<br>What did you think of that exercise?<br>What if the whole earth reminded you of what God had said? <br>What if every time you took your mind off of considering everything around you through the lens of the Spirit, it was automatically back to the mindset of the flesh?<br>What would if take for you to train yourself on keeping your mind on the Spirit at all times?<br>Through this lens, does the bible verse below mean anything different to what you've thought it to mean?<br>16&nbsp;Rejoice always, 17&nbsp;pray without ceasing, 18&nbsp;give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.1 Thessalonians 5:16-18<br><br>
<br>Do you observe a Sabbath's day rest?
<br>What is your practice?
<br>Is your mindset part of your Sabbath day?
<br>What does it mean to you to keep it holy?

<br><br>The word genesis means the origin. Genesis is the first book in the Christian scriptural library referred to as the Bible. It is also the first book in the collection of scripture of the Jewish faith called the Torah. This book is the explanation for the creation of things as we know it and also the origin of the people chosen to display who God is to the world. This book along with Exodus, Leviticus, Number and Deuteronomy, is believed to be written down by Moses–and prior to it's writing down–it's stories were passed down by word of mouth. We zone in on chapter 1 verse 26. The creation is unfolding with YHWH God having already made the earth, moon, stars, sea animals, birds and land creatures. He calls it good, then moves on to His last creation, mankind. To note: In Genesis chapter 2 starting from verse 2, once the overview of creation is given, the story back tracks and gives a more detailed account of the creation of mankind.<br>
    While reading this passage, we will put a triangle for every reference for&nbsp;God, His image, including pronouns, titles etc; a line for any reference to the&nbsp;flesh, including body and words like them; a heart around every reference for&nbsp;Adam or Eve directly, including descriptors and plural pronouns; a down arrow for&nbsp;serpent, death and words like it, and an up arrow for&nbsp;life, good, holy and words like it; a symbol like this for a&nbsp;command, actual commands, and words like it.

						26&nbsp;Then God said, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.”
					27 So God created man in his own image,<br>in the image of God he created him;<br>male and female he created them.
					
					
             28 And God blessed them. And God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth.” 29&nbsp;And God said, “Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit. You shall have them for food. 30&nbsp;And to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the heavens and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food.” And it was so. 31&nbsp;And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.

&nbsp;&nbsp;15&nbsp;The Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and keep it. 16 And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, “You may surely eat of every tree of the garden,  17&nbsp;but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.”


18&nbsp;Then the Lord God said, “It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for him.” 19 Now out of the ground the Lord God had formed every beast of the field and every bird of the heavens and brought them to the man to see what he would call them. And whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name. 20&nbsp;The man gave names to all livestock and to the birds of the heavens and to every beast of the field. But for Adam there was not found a helper fit for him. 21 So the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and while he slept took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh. 22 And the rib that the Lord God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man. 23 Then the man said,


“This at last is bone of my bones<br>
    and flesh of my flesh;<br>
she shall be called Woman,<br>
    because she was taken out of Man.”<br>


	24 Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh. 25 And the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed.

						1 Now the serpent was more crafty than any other beast of the field that the Lord God had made. 
						
						He said to the woman, “Did God actually say, ‘You shall not eat of any tree in the garden’?” 2 And the woman said to the serpent, “We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden, 3 but God said, ‘You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.’” 4 But the serpent said to the woman, “You will not surely die. 5 For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.” 6 So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate, and she also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate. 7 Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked. And they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loincloths.

  Please do your best to answer the questions as simply as you can based on the text given and not any prior knowledge you may have, even if it's biblical. <br><br>Questions with asterisks* may inquire about general definitions and meaning not found in the text, for those you may use your common knowledge.

  
<br>
<br>Were Adam and Eve created sinful?
<br>According to Paul's Roadmap to death, when did sin come alive?
<br>Are there any differences or steps left out in Adam and Eve's case?
<br>What does the serpent represent here?
<br>In verse 6, what was Eve's mind set on? What caused her mindset to shift?
<br>Does there always need to be a "serpent" for this roadmap to sin to take place?
<br>According to Paul, at what point can we stop this roadmap from happening?
<br>Is there any other way to get out of the flesh sin cycle according to these scriptures?
<br>A change occurred in verse 7, what was it according to Paul? 
<br>Once their eyes were opened, could they go back to the same state of their eyes being unopened?

Out of all of the scriptures of the bible, nothing quite captures the angst we may sometimes feel as believers when we are not fulfilling the potential we know is there within us, like in Romans 7, where Apostle Paul declares, "O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" This can be especially frustrating in light of the goodness of God that we have experienced and our knowledge of the scriptures. The good we desire to do sometimes ridiculously eludes us and the motivation we once had seems to flap in the wind like a tattered and weather beaten flag, flickering here and there, but not standing at full mast as it once did. The last of the energy to pursue Kingdom like "good" Christians should, has fizzled out and left us struggling to make what seems like simple and straight forward decisions.<br>This study, based on biblical truths, suggests our issue may be that our current fuel is not efficient nor effective in producing lasting and consistent obedience; that current fuel being, feelings. If we operate by doing what we feel like doing, our flesh will make it impossible for us to experience the victory that is already ours through Christ Jesus. That is because feelings are the perfect fuel for the flesh and sub-optimal for the spirit. We need a fuel that goes beyond feelings, one that runs through the spiritual being, producing life, even when we find ourselves in the most perplexing of circumstances.<br>What if it isn't just the fuel that needs to be changed but the inner workings of the spirit man that need a tune up? Here enters soul care, the maintenance that we didn't want but truly need to be everything He's called us to be and we know we could be.<br>If we knew how to consistently operate outside of feelings, we'd be doing it already. The resistance we are facing in this spiritual paralysis mimics a body system overrun with toxicity. The organs of the spirit; the non-physical heart, mind and soul are bogged down with spiritual toxins like unresolved hurts, traumas, bad habits made out of good intentions, not to mention uncombated oppression from the enemy.<br>These things and more have zapped our strength and maybe worse, even skewed our perception of the Godhead, and ourselves. Jesus' sacrifice doesn't just offer salvation of the soul, healing of the body and resurrection life. He was also prophesied to be the Wonderful Counselor, so we can follow the command to love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind and strength.<br>This is a study on how to allow yourself to be counseled directly by the Spirit of Christ.<br>For some, you may not be feeling like you are at your wits end, as it is described above, but you know there is more that you want to experience and can experience in this life with Christ. You have a hunger and thirst for righteousness and a desire to see the Kingdom of God expanded like never before and all you want to do is get in line. Preparation and God-readiness is required to subdue your dreams. There may be things that He needs to address that you may or may not know are there–before you are unleashed on assignment. That requires His counsel. That requires soul care.<br>Although this not a self help on how to become your best you, that will inevitably end up happening if you allow Christ to counsel you and change you from a feelings-driven, sometimey-Christian, to one who rises to the occasion; not allowing sin or circumstance to rattle your eagle-eye view. You are not doing this to become a more productive child of God; you are doing it as an acceptance of a marriage proposal that will unify you into the family of God in a way that brings value to the family. The value that He has seen in you all along.<br>This Course uses the inductive Bible study method which draws it's conclusions based on what was studied from the text which is different from deductive bible study in which we bring our predisposed assumptions, whether original or learned to interpret the text being examined. It's main steps are observation, interpretation and application and it's main goal is to bring deeper and genuine understanding of scripture.<br>American Author and believer Kay Arthur, founder of Precept Ministries created a visual method for use in tandem with the inductive Bible study method. For this study, we've borrowed some of the techniques used in the Precept Bible Study Method™. Find out more at Precept.org<br>Before we dive into the study, let's do the most important thing of all: let's invite God into this conversation through prayer. Take a moment to ask Him to speak to you through His written Word, the Bible.<br>This is Concept 2, to visit Concept 1, use the link below<br>
